# Adhoc Insights Using Python for Hospitality Domain

This project simulates the role of a data analyst in the **hospitality industry**, performing an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on booking and hotel performance data. The objective was to uncover insights from various datasets to support data-driven business decisions in areas like revenue trends, room utilization, and seasonal booking patterns.

## 🎯 Objective

The hospitality sector thrives on timely decisions driven by accurate data. This project aimed to:

- Perform in-depth EDA using hotel booking data  
- Identify trends across cities, room types, and booking timelines  
- Analyze revenue contributions and customer behavior  
- Support decision-making for hotel performance and planning

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive workflow  

---

## 📁 Datasets Used

- `dim_date.csv` – Date dimension  
- `dim_hotels.csv` – Hotel metadata  
- `dim_rooms.csv` – Room types and information  
- `fact_bookings.csv` – Booking-level transactional data  
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` – Pre-aggregated booking summaries  

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- ✅ Cleaned and merged multiple hospitality datasets  
- ✅ Explored booking trends by city, hotel, room type, and time  
- ✅ Analyzed revenue realized per city and per month  
- ✅ Compared weekday vs weekend occupancy  
- ✅ Visualized month-on-month trends to inform peak season planning  
- ✅ Prepared data for further predictive modeling or dashboarding  

---

## 📈 Skills Gained

- 🔹 Translating raw booking data into actionable insights  
- 🔹 Creating time-series and categorical analysis in hospitality context  
- 🔹 Understanding occupancy patterns and revenue drivers  
- 🔹 Communicating EDA results effectively with visuals  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This exploratory analysis revealed important patterns such as:

- **City-wise revenue distribution** and **monthly booking trends** are key to targeted marketing.  
- **Occupancy was higher on weekends**, especially in tourist-heavy cities.  
- **Room types and hotel categories** play a significant role in revenue contribution.  
- The project lays a strong foundation for future **forecasting**, **pricing strategy**, and **capacity planning** in the hospitality sector.
